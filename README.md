# BINGX-MAIN
# The general strategy is that in the time frames 1w-1d-4h-1h-15min, it starts checking the contract entered through the pair.txt file (times have the ability to be active and inactive) and then if all the values ​​of the supertrend indicator in the time the above, being in the same direction (upward or downward), the second part of the program, which starts placing orders in the 1 and 5 minute time frames, which of course is selective, and the bot in the 1 or 5 minute time frame follows the first change in the value of the supertrend, which has a direction which is specified, and continues to open the position as long as the above condition is met. This part of the bot is fully executed and has no problems. (There is a calculation error, it is probably related to leverage) - and the long positions are not as accurate as they should be: the entry point of a candle is delayed - the loss limit should be equal to the value of the super trend at the time of entering the position, but it is not exact - target It is set in the config file, but it doesn't work well and it's not what you expect from it - it goes without saying that the dollar threshold is also adjustable, but it's not accurate. #
